Gratings Manual Processing Procedures
/data/mta/www/mta_grat/README

- find new gratings obs
    ls -l $cache/*/acis/*evt1a* | more
    ls -l $cache/*/hrc/*evt1a* | more
  recent obs written on brad's whiteboard

- cp new level 1.5 evt files to /data/mta/www/mta_grat

- cd to /data/mta/www/mta_grat

- add entries for each image in command.pro
    - filename
    - directory (make new monthly directory if necessary)
    - roll angle (- ROLL_PNT)
    - detector
    - grating
    - cc_mode_flag (ask brad if cc_mode)

- run   idl> @command
  click on zero order when prompted

- add entries in obs2html.lst
  (the order that things appear in this file is
   important, most recent obs listed first)
  run idl> obs2html

- mark on brad's hardcopy (bulletin board) and whiteboard

- if analysis is OK add entries to
   1) Zero/obslist - OK if zero order is identified.  If not, the rest
                  are not OK either.
                  (Determine Zero-order...  section)
   2) Angles/obslist - OK if angles are identified, just that you can see
                    them in plot, don't pay attention to fit line.
                    (Measure Grating Angle(s)..  section)
   3) Focus/obslist - OK if there is a good fit to zero order and streak
                 (Detailed Examine Zero-order Spatial...  section)
                 (No streak for HRC)
   4) EdE/obslist - OK if there are clear lines with good fits 
                 (Outputing Histograms of Spectra...  section)
  (order not important)

At end of month:
- run  >update
  calls Zero/zo_loc.pro
        Angles/angles.pro
        obs2html.pro
      to update web pages
